It defines the relationship between data and the operations that can be performed on it.\n","\n","  There are two main types of data structures:\n","\n","- Linear Data Structures – Elements are arranged sequentially.\n","Examples: Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues\n","- Non-Linear Data Structures – Elements are arranged in a hierarchical or interconnected manner.\n","Examples: Trees, Graphs, Hash Tables, Heaps\n","\n","  Why Are Data Structures Important?\n","- Efficiency – They help in efficiently managing and retrieving data, reducing time and space complexity.\n","- Scalability – Well-chosen data structures allow applications to handle large amounts of data effectively.\n","- Better Problem Solving – Many algorithms rely on specific data structures for optimization (e.g., Dijkstra’s algorithm uses priority queues).\n","- Code Maintainability – Organizing data properly makes code more readable and maintainable.\n","- Optimized Resource Usage – Proper data structure selection leads to better memory and processing power utilization.\n","\n","2.Explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types with examples?\n","  >>- Mutable Data Types\n","Definition: Mutable objects can be changed after creation without changing their identity (i.e., the memory address remains the same).\n","Examples:\n","Lists\n","Dictionaries\n","Sets\n","- Immutable Data Types\n","Definition: Immutable objects cannot be changed after creation. Any modification creates a new object.\n","Examples:\n","Integers\n","Floats\n","Tuples\n","Strings\n","Booleans\n","\n","3.What are the main differences between lists and tuples in Python?\n","  >>Lists\n","   - Both lists and tuples are used to store collections of items in Python, but they have key differences in behavior and performance.\n","   Use Lists when you need to modify data frequently (e.g., dynamic collections, sorting, appending).\n","Use Tuples when you want fixed, unchangeable data (e.g., coordinates, database records, constants).\n","\n","4.Describe how dictionaries store data ?\n","  >>Python dictionaries use a hash table with the following process:\n","\n","  Hashing the Key\n","\n","- The dictionary computes a hash value (a unique number) for the key using Python’s built-in hash() function.\n","Finding an Index\n","\n","- The hash value determines the index in the internal array where the key-value pair is stored.\n","If two different keys generate the same index (collision), Python uses a collision resolution technique (e.g., open addressing).\n","Retrieval Process\n","\n","- When accessing a value using dict[key], Python:\n","Computes the hash of the key.\n","Locates the corresponding index.\n","Returns the associated value in constant time O(1) (on average).\n","\n","5.Why might you use a set instead of a list in Python?\n","  >>When to Use a Set Instead of a List\n","✅ 1. Removing Duplicates Efficiently\n","Since sets automatically remove duplicates, they are useful for cleaning data.\n","✅ 2. Faster Membership Checking (in operator)\n","Sets: O(1) average time complexity (uses a hash table).\n","Lists: O(n) worst-case time complexity (requires full traversal).\n","✅ 3. Mathematical Set Operations\n","Sets support union, intersection, and difference operations.\n","3. When NOT to Use a Set\n","❌ Order Matters → Use a list (list maintains insertion order).\n","❌ Duplicate Elements Are Needed → Lists allow duplicates.\n","❌ Index-Based Access Required → Sets don’t support indexing (set[0] is invalid).\n","\n","6. What is a string in Python, and how is it different from a list?\n","  >>A string in Python is a sequence of characters enclosed in quotes (' or \"). It is immutable, meaning it cannot be changed after creation.\n","  Key Differences with Examples\n","  - Strings Are Immutable, Lists Are Mutable.\n","  - Lists Can Store Different Data Types, Strings Cannot.\n","  ✅ Use a string when working with text-based data (sentences, file paths, etc.).\n","✅ Use a list when handling collections of different elements (numbers, objects, etc.).\n","\n","7. How do tuples ensure data integrity in Python?\n","   >>Tuples in Python are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed after creation. This immutability provides data integrity by ensuring that the data remains consistent and unchanged throughout a program.\n","\n","8. What is a hash table, and how does it relate to dictionaries in Python?\n","  >> A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a data structure that stores key-value pairs using a hash function to compute an index (or address) where values are stored. It allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions in average O(1) time complexity.Python dictionaries (dict) are implemented using hash tables. Each dictionary key is hashed, and the hash value determines where the value is stored in memory.\n","\n","9. Can lists contain different data types in Python?  \n","  >>Yes! Python lists can hold elements of different data types, including integers, strings, floats, booleans, other lists, tuples, dictionaries, and even functions.\n","\n","10. Explain why strings are immutable in Python?\n","  >>Reasons for String Immutability\n","- Memory Efficiency (String Interning)\n","Python optimizes memory usage by reusing immutable strings.\n","If two variables have the same string value, Python points them to the same memory location.\n","- Hashing and Dictionary Keys\n","Strings are hashable, allowing them to be used as keys in dictionaries.\n","Hashing requires fixed (unchangeable) values to ensure consistent lookup times.\n","- Thread Safety\n","Since strings cannot be modified, multiple threads can safely share them without synchronization issues.\n","- Security Benefits\n","String immutability prevents accidental or malicious modification of critical data, such as passwords.\n","\n","11.  What advantages do dictionaries offer over lists for certain tasks?\n","  >>Dictionaries (dict) and lists (list) are both common data structures in Python, but dictionaries are better suited for certain tasks due to their key-value mapping and O(1) lookup speed.\n","\n","12. Describe a scenario where using a tuple would be preferable over a list?\n","  >> Scenario Where a Tuple Is Preferable Over a List\n","Scenario: Storing GPS Coordinates\n","A tuple is ideal for storing GPS coordinates (latitude, longitude) because these values are fixed and should not be modified.\n","\n","13. How do sets handle duplicate values in Python?\n","  >> Sets automatically remove duplicate values when elements are added. This ensures that every element in a set is unique.\n","  How Sets Work with Duplicates\n","When adding elements, Python checks for duplicates and only keeps unique values.\n","If a duplicate is added, it is ignored automatically.\n","\n","14. How does the “in” keyword work differently for lists and dictionaries?\n","  >>The in keyword is used to check for membership in both lists and dictionaries, but its behavior differs between these two data structures.\n","  - Checking Membership in a List\n","When you use the in keyword with a list, Python checks if the value is present in the list.\n","It checks for element presence by going through the list and comparing each value.\n","  - Checking Membership in a Dictionary\n","When you use the in keyword with a dictionary, it checks for key membership by default, not values.\n","It checks if the key exists in the dictionary, not whether the value exists.\n","\n","15.  Can you modify the elements of a tuple? Explain why or why not?\n","  >> No, you cannot modify the elements of a tuple once it has been created. This is because tuples are immutable in Python.\n","\n","16.  What is a nested dictionary, and give an example of its use case?  \n","  >> A nested dictionary in Python is a dictionary where the values are themselves dictionaries. This allows for the representation of complex, hierarchical data structures, where you can store and organize related data under multiple levels of keys.\n","\n","   Use Case of a Nested Dictionary: Managing Employee Data\n","   Imagine a company that needs to store information about multiple employees, each of whom may have personal details and work-related information. A nested dictionary can be used to structure this data.\n","\n","17. Describe the time complexity of accessing elements in a dictionary?\n","  >> In Python, accessing elements in a dictionary is very efficient, with O(1) time complexity in the average case. This makes dictionaries one of the most efficient data structures for key-value lookups. The O(n) worst-case scenario is rare and usually occurs due to hash collisions, but Python’s hash table implementation is optimized to handle these efficiently.\n","\n","18.  In what situations are lists preferred over dictionaries?\n","  >> Both lists and dictionaries are useful, but lists are preferred in certain scenarios where maintaining order, indexing, or simplicity is important.\n","\n","19. Why are dictionaries considered unordered, and how does that affect data retrieval?\n","  >>- Conceptual Unorderedness: Dictionaries are unordered collections designed for efficient key-value lookups using hash tables, not for maintaining a specific order.\n","    - Data Retrieval (O(1)): Accessing data by key is still fast  \n","     (O(1)) regardless of the insertion order.\n","    - Insertion Order (Python 3.7+): While dictionaries now\n","     maintain insertion order in Python 3.7+, their primary design is based on efficient key-value mapping rather than order.\n","\n","20.  Explain the difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval?\n","  >> The primary difference between a list and a dictionary in terms of data retrieval lies in how the data is stored and accessed.\n","  - List\n","  Access by Index: Data in a list is stored in a sequence and can be accessed using a numeric index (an integer representing the position of an element).\n","  - Dictionary\n","  Access by Key: In a dictionary, data is stored as key-value pairs. Each value is accessed by its key (which can be a string, number, or any hashable object).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","    \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","  \n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"mTQKVAC1_aXy"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# PRACTICAL QUESTIONS"],"metadata":{"id":"wJNG6r6BFezV"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#1 Write a code to create a string with your name and print it.\n","# Create a string with my name\n","my_name = \"Vikas Sehgal\"\n","\n","# Print the string\n","print(my_name)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"R6qz31zTFySx","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738943270854,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":665,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"017ada24-450c-42b4-829a-3f75812a5d19"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Vikas Sehgal\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"OeDCyFe6GZm3"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["#2 Write a code to find the length of the string \"Hello World\".\n","# Create the string\n","my_string = \"Hello World\"\n","\n","# Find the length of the string\n","length_of_string = len(my_string)\n","\n","# Print the length\n","print(\"The length of the string is:\", length_of_string)\n"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"lyiYkRbk_BlT","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738943366227,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":861,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"0534a0e6-3edd-455b-8a3d-60a10696a789"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The length of the string is: 11\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"cQ4Py1ZC-_oE"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"YJuR2FW9-6iP","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738943459530,"user_tz":-330,"elapsed":980,"user":{"displayName":"Vikas Sehgal","userId":"03708495465943345768"}},"outputId":"3c4ce208-c78a-4e17-aa1c-abc38c36349b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["The first 3 characters are: Pyt\n"]}],"source":["#3.
